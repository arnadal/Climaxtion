    <h4>These days there are many factors contributing to climate change. The main causes are nested below.</h4>
    </div>
    <br><br>
  
    <div class="small">
    <h4>Generating power:</h4>
    <p>Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide – powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat. </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="small_right">
    <h4> Manufacturing goods: </h4>
    <p>Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also release gases, as does the construction industry. Machines used in the manufacturing process often run on coal, oil, or gas; and some materials, like plastics, are made from chemicals sourced from fossil fuels.</p> 
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="small">
    <h4> Cutting down forests:</h4>
    <p>Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Each year approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="small_right">
    <h4> Producing food:</h4>
    <p>Producing food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in various ways, including through deforestation and clearing of land for agriculture and grazing, digestion by cows and sheep, the production and use of fertilizers and manure for growing crops, and the use of energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels. All this makes food production a major contributor to climate change. </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="small">
    <h4>  Consuming too much:</h4>
    <p>Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat and how much you throw away all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, electronics, and plastics. A large chunk of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked to private households. Our lifestyles have a profound impact on our planet. </p>
